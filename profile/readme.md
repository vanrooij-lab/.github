# Overview of the Van Rooij code repository

Over the last few years code that has been developed in the Van Rooij lab was collected here.

# Get full access to this repository

If you are a member of the lab, to see a more elaborate explanation, and all available repositories, you need to log in to github, and make sure you are a member of our 'github team'. Ask the responisible person in the lab about this.

### Technical note

Note that the readme.md file (ie what you're reading now) is located in a repository too, and the private and public version can respectively be found in the .github-private and .github repositories. These can also be cloned and in that way easily edited. They can also be edited online easily if you're logged in and have access.
