Over the last few years code that has been developed in the Van Rooij lab was collected here.

Initially, Joep set up and was main contributor to this reposotiry, afterwards Martijn took over, and recently Kees is the main responsible person for this repository.

## Some comments regarding the use of Github

### What are github/git?

Git is a version control system that allows multiple people to work on a project at the same time without overwriting each other's changes. It keeps track of changes made to the project over time, allowing users to revert back to previous versions if needed.

GitHub.com is a web-based hosting service for Git repositories. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing and sharing Git repositories, and offers additional features such as issue tracking, code reviewing, and collaboration tools. For novice users, GitHub can be a great place to learn coding, collaborate on projects, and contribute to open source software.


When you write code for a specific project, this is typically stored into a folder on your computer. You can tell the Git software to track this folder to offer the above functionalities.
Git is a very basic piece of software that can be accessed through the command line of a termina, once installed. But you can also use additional software, like **sourcetree**, or **VS studio** (a code editor) with git/github support. Also Rstudio has git/github support, but when I last used it, I didn't find that very convenient.

There are public and hidden repositories here.
